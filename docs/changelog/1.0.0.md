libyuni - release v1.0.0
========================


New
---

 * **{core}** Multihreading:

   - Introduced new convenient utility routines for Multithreading Programming:
     `spawn`, `every`, `async` and `sync` (see `yuni/thread/utility.h` for more details)
   - `Yuni::IThread` is now able to set the internal thread stack size via a parameter
     from its constructor, mainly to reduce memory consumption when a lot of threads are involved.
     The default value has been set to 512K, which should be large enough for most scenarios.

 * **{core}** C++11/14 support enhancement:

	- `Yuni::Bind` now supports C++11 lambda
	- `Yuni::String` now supports move semantic
	- Multiple fixes related to C++11/14 standards

 * **{core}** `Yuni::SmartPtr` is now able to detect if an ownership policy does not seem appropriate
   (see changes about intrusive smart pointers - COMReferenceCounted policy)

 * **{core}** An helper class is now available to detect at compile time if a specific typedef
   is available within a given class and his ancestors (see `yuni/core/static/typedef.h`)

 * **{core}** `System::Console`: new routines `IsStdoutTTY()` and `IsStderrTTY()` to determine
   whether the standard output (or standard error output) is a TTY or not

 * **{core}** added new class Yuni::Tribool, a 3-state boolean

 * **{core}** added typedefs `float32`, `float64`

 * **{core}** Bind: added method `empty()` and `operator !` to determine if an object is binded

 * **{core/functional}** added `Functional::Fold()` routine

 * **{dbi}** The DBI/sqlite adapter is now ready for production

 * **{io}** `Yuni::IO::LoadFromFile` now accepts std::string as a destination



Changes
-------

 * **{core}** Smart pointers:

    - `IIntrusiveSmartPtr<T>` now uses a non recursive mutex.
	- `Yuni::SmartPtr` won't compile when using the COMReferenceCounted ownership policy
	  (intrusive smart ptr, the reference counter is inside the object) if the
	  underlying object does not have the required methods (`addRef`, `release`, and
	  `hasIntrusiveSmartPtr`) The abstract class `IIntrusiveSmartPtr` should be used for
	  implementing intrusive smart pointer.
    - The method `SmartPtr::unique()` has been removed due to thread-safety issues
    - `IIntrusiveSmartPtr::onRelease` is now const.

 * **{core}** Jobs:

   - `Yuni::Job::IJob` and `Yuni::Thread::IThread` now use intrusive smartptr
     to reduce memory allocation in high workload environments. Consequently it may not compile
     for some old program. Use `IJob::Ptr::Promote<T>::Ptr` or `Thread::IThread::Ptr::Promote<T>::Ptr`
     to get the appropriate smartptr type.
   - `<yuni/job/queue/queue.h>` has been remamed to `<yuni/job/queue/service.h>` for consistency
   - `<yuni/job/queue.h>` has been removed. Please use `<yuni/job/queue/service.h>` instead
   - `Yuni::Job::QueueService` is no longer a template class and has been
     internally revamped

 * **{core}** Variants:

   - The variant's types have been renamed (`Yuni::Variant::tString` is now `Yuni::variantTString`)

 * **{core}** Math/Geometry:
   - the methods `Point2D::closeTo()` have been renamed to `Point2D::isCloseTo()`
   - the methods `Point3D::closeTo()` have been renamed to `Point3D::isCloseTo()`

 * **{core}** Misc: msinttypes for Visual Studio has been updated to r29 (http://code.google.com/p/msinttypes/)

 * **{core}** Event::Loop: added the method `gracefulStop()`

 * **{core}** Point2D and Point3D : Added operator * and *=.

 * **{core}** String : added an optional boolean to `words()` to keep empty lines

 * **{dbi}** Updated sqlite to v3.8.3

 * **{gl}** Updated glew to v1.10




Fixes
-----

 * **{core}** Fixed Clang compiler detection

 * **{core}** Fixed compilation on Visual Studio 2013

 * **{core}** `Yuni::Timer`: Fixed a potential race condition

 * **{core}** Math/Geometry : added missing `operator**{}** const` for `Point2D`, `Point3D`, and `Vector3D`.

 * **{core}** Fixed the method `Yuni::String::split()` with list or vector of `AnyString`,
   which was producing unpredictable results (ex: calling `String("1,2,3").split(mylist, ",")`
   with `mylist` as `AnyString::Vector`)

 * **{core}** Fixed the method `IO::Directory::Info::clean()`, which was only deleting subfolders

 * **{core}** removed overload on std::vector/std::list with std::ostream

 * **{core}** #462: string: fixes implicit cast to bool when assigning an int from the constructor

 * **{core}** `Yuni::String`: istartsWith was not case-insensitive

 * **{core}** #351, #358: System::Environment::Read now handle Unicode value on Windows

 * **{core}** #463: Bind: fixed invalid pointer when unbinding (VS2013)

 * **{io}** Fixed directory and file iterators when given a path containing mixed slashes and backslashes.
