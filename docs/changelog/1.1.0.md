New
---

 * **{core}** **{event}** added `fold` method for callback result folding

    ```
	Event<uint ()> evt;
	evt.connect([]() -> uint { return 10u; });
	evt.connect([]() -> uint { return 4u; });
	std::cout << evt.fold(0u, Lambda::Add<uint>()) << std::endl; // 14
    ```

 * **{core}** Functional: Support for collection Views with fold, filter, map
   and many pre-defined binary operations for folding.

 * **{core}** String: added operator overloads for easier UTF8::Char / multi-byte
   string comparisons.

 * **{core}** String: now accepts wide strings

 * **{core}** added `Yuni::WString`, a lightweight helper for manipulating wide strings

 * **{core}** added `Yuni::HashCombine` (`yuni/core/stl/hash-combine.h`) to easily
   compute the the hash of complex structs.

 * **{core}** added `Yuni::deleteAndNull` and `deleteArrayAndNull`, to delete an object
   and set the underlying variable to null in one call

 * **{core}** added `Yuni::Math::RoundUp`, for rounding up to the nearest multiple of a number

 * **{core}** added `Yuni::NonMovable`

 * **{core}** added `Yuni::System::Environment::ReadAsBool` and `Yuni::System::Environment::ReadAsInt64`
   Those functions can be useful for performance reasons (avoids memory allocations whever it
   is possible), where the string value is not required

 * **{io}** added `Yuni::IO::FetchFileStatus()`, to retrieve in one call the type,
    the size and the timestamp of the last modifcation of a filename

 * **{jobs}** added `Yuni::Job::Taskgroup`, for easily handling groups of jobs

 * **{jobs}** added the method `gracefulStop()` to the queue service to ask
   it to stop as soon as possible. The big advantage to this method is it
   can be called from any threads, unlike `stop()` which may create a
   deadlock if called from a job.

 * **{jobs}** added the method `clear()` to the queue service to remove all jobs
   waiting to be executed

 * **{parser}** JSON export

 * **{sample}** **{parser}** added json parser

 * **{core}** The warning '-Wsitch' on gcc/clang (enumeration value not handled in switch) is now an error.
   For legacy programs, the `default` clause can be added where appropriate.


Changes
-------

 * **{core}** `Yuni::Process` has been renamed `Yuni::Process::Program`.

 * **{core}** `Yuni::Process` do no longer automatically redirect the output
   of the subprocess to the standard output of the parent process.
   The method `Yuni::Process::Program::redirectToConsole(bool)` can be use to
   modify this behavior.

 * **{core}** Fold : Renamed `Yuni::Functional::Fold` to `Yuni::fold`.

 * **{core}** String: both the methods `String::format()` and `String::appendFormat()`
   now use `const char* format` instead of `const AnyString& format`.
   Reason: 'va_start' has undefined behavior with reference types. You
   can use `String::c_str()` if old code were using Yuni::String as input format.

 * **{core}** Jobs: The method `wait` of the queue service now requires an event
   to distinguish the different use-cases. Uses `qseIdle` to wait for all jobs
   being executed (this value should represent the old behavior of `wait`)
   or use `qseStop` to wait for the queue service being stopped (by
   `stop()` or `gracefulStop()`).

 * **{core}** `String::words`: empty elements are now kept by default, as it was stated
   in the documentation.

 * **{core}** Updated the list of Microsoft Security Development Lifecycle (SDL) banned APIs

 * **{io}** `IO::NodeType` has new possible values to better match UNIX characteristics:
   `typeSymLink`, `typeSocket` and `typeSpecial`

 * **{io}** `IO::TypeOf()` now accepts an optional parameter `followSymLink`

 * **{jobs}** Overall Performance Improvement

 * **{jobs}** `Yuni::Job::QueueService` now uses an intrusive smartptr

 * **{dbi}** upgraded to sqlite 3.9.1



Fixes
-----

 * **{core}** Detection of the clang compiler when CMAKE_CXX_COMPILER is not used

 * [core] Fixed return value of Yuni::String::replace(char, char) which always returned 0
   (instead of the number of replaced characters as expected)


Deprecated
----------

 * **{vm}** This module is now deprecated and will be removed in future releases
