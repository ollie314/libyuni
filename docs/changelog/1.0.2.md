libyuni - release v1.0.2
========================


Changes
-------

 * **{core}** String: the method `String::format()` and `String::appendFormat()`
   now use `const char* format` instead of `const AnyString& format`.
   Reason: 'va_start' has undefined behavior with reference types. You
   can use `String::c_str()` if old code were using Yuni::String as input format.

   This patch breaks ABI compatibility for the branch 1.0.x, but since it would
   lead to undefined behavior, it has been backported from v1.1.


Fixes
-----

 * **{core}** Fixed compilation with clang 3.5
